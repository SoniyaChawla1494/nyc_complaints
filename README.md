# Stay Vigilant,Stay Safe NYC

Our version of crime predictor and classifier ,to alert people of areas prone to crime.

# Why is our project Unique?
Our project is a system which predicts the number of crime reports which might occur in an area in future,so that police department can be alerted beforehand.
Also it classifies and determines which area of New York is more prone to what kind of crime,targeted towards which gender/age/race .Our project is unique as it tries to improve the police services(leading to social security) as well as aim to create social awareness and equal opportunities for people who are targeted in such criminal activities.

# Inspiration behind this project?
1) According to the data report from New York Police Department,there are around 1800 criminal reports filed every 28 days.
2) We as students,who return home after evening lectures are at a constant risk of being exploited by any criminal activity.
3) Every part of New York confronts a different high in terms of various criminal activities.So area based analysis to identify risk factors in any particular area has become very important.
4) Often various crimes are targeted towards gender or race of individual,so to mitigate the effects of such type of injustice,we need to identify the areas and the target population ,to help take the right steps in the direction of Social betterment of the society as a whole.
5) A small model built if built with good accuracy,can serve as blueprint for various other cities which face similar problems.

# What does our project do?
 1.Analyzes NYC’s historic complaint data.
 2.makes use of ML algorithms to predict no. of crimes occurring in a district.
 3.Predicts the offence type based on the feature of the observations.
 4.Making use of BOSE API to give advice about crime situation with reliable degree of accuracy.
 5.Spatial analysis to identify hot spots and cold spots of various criminal activities.

# How did we build it?
1) Collected data from NYC Open data about historic Crime reports.
2)Cleaned and preprocessed data to fit it to Machine Learning Models.
3)Applied time series analysis to the data
4)Also applied Deep Learning Model(LSTM) for time series prediction.
5)Used ANN for classification.
6)Random Forest,Decision Tree,Voting classifier,Logistic regression,Multinomial Naive Bayes,Multi layer Perceptron(MLP) models applied for forecasting and classification.
7)Wrote a script for text to speech conversion,which takes the output text of the model and gives it as an input to BOSE API.
8)Wrote a script to convert the text input to audio output and play it on BOSE Speaker.

# Accomplishments we you proud of!
1.Analysis drawn from the data which can be beneficial to many people in many ways.
2.Predictions with high accuracy which can aid to awareness and safety of New Yorkers.
3.Highly detailed data analysis was achieved within a short time frame.
4.Leaning BOSE API usage and Google’s Text-to-Speech API.
5.Our Machine Learning algorithm spanned multiple types of models.
6.Took the plunge in Deep Learning for the first time to get a comparative study.
7.Attempted to understand spatial and temporal nature of data.(if any)

# What did we learn by building it
1.BOSE API Usage
2.Google Cloud Usage
3.Deep Learning
4.Delegating work and time management
5.Importance of team work

# Future Scope
 1.Automating location detection and then giving appropriate alerts.
 2.Automated detection of AR and MA parameters for Time series analysis.
 3.Automating the collection of data in a periodic manner.
 4.Looking for secondary datasets which might augment and increase the accuracy of our analysis.
